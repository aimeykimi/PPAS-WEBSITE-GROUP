        <h1 class="title">HOW PERBADANAN PERPUSTAKAAN AWAM SELANGOR WAS BEGIN</h1>
        <p>
            The Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Selangor (PPAS) was established as part of the Malaysian government’s initiative to enhance public library services across the nation. The foundation of PPAS can be traced back to the early 1990s when the state of Selangor recognized the need for a structured library system that could cater to the growing population and their educational needs. The establishment aimed not only to provide access to books and information but also to promote reading culture among the citizens. This initiative was aligned with Malaysia’s broader objectives of fostering knowledge and lifelong learning, which were essential for national development.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            In its formative years, PPAS focused on creating a network of libraries throughout Selangor, ensuring that even rural areas had access to library services. The organization began with a few branches and gradually expanded its reach by incorporating modern technologies and diverse resources into its offerings. This included digital libraries, online catalogues, and various community programs designed to engage different demographics within the state. Over time, PPAS has evolved into a comprehensive public library system that not only serves as a repository of knowledge but also as a community hub for cultural and educational activities.
